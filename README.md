Arduino Race Logger
===================

This is a basic data acquisition component for recording data related to motorsports, the goal is to build a simple and cheap logger that can be used to provide data for other software to analyze. 

Our sensor of interest are:

 -  GPS @ 10HZ 
 -  3D Accelerometer at 10HZ
 -  Two pulse sensors (one for tachometer and one for speed sensor)
 -  One isolated A/D for throttle position sensor

 - All data is recorded to an SD card

Current Status
==============

The software appears to work and an initial breadboard has been built and tested, prototype boards are in production.
